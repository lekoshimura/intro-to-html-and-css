0:00:00.170,0:00:02.280
With five columns right off the bat,

0:00:02.280,0:00:05.090
we know that we can't do four columns evenly.

0:00:05.090,0:00:06.010
So this can't be right.

0:00:07.100,0:00:10.750
With eight columns, it's impossible to have three evenly spaced columns.

0:00:10.750,0:00:12.830
So we know that eight columns isn't right.

0:00:12.830,0:00:17.810
With 12 columns, we know that 2, 3, and 4 all divide into 12 evenly.

0:00:17.810,0:00:21.063
Meaning that we can have two even columns, three even columns or

0:00:21.063,0:00:23.380
four even columns on the screen.

0:00:23.380,0:00:24.940
So this seems like a pretty good answer.

0:00:24.940,0:00:26.350
But let's think about 20.

0:00:26.350,0:00:30.190
With 20 columns, 3 doesn't divide into 20 evenly.

0:00:30.190,0:00:33.710
So we know that we can't do three even columns on the screen.

0:00:33.710,0:00:36.870
Also, you'll notice that people need to be able to read things.

0:00:36.870,0:00:41.000
And if a column is one 20th of the screen, it's going to be pretty tiny and

0:00:41.000,0:00:42.380
that's going to be hard to see.

0:00:42.380,0:00:44.940
So, I can't imagine us ever needing a column that small.

0:00:44.940,0:00:47.120
This means that the correct answer is 12 columns.

0:00:47.120,0:00:49.720
And in fact, most of the grid systems,

0:00:49.720,0:00:53.310
if not all of the grids systems that you'll see today use 12 columns.
