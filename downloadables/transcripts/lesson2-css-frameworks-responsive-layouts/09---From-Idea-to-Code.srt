Now that you've got the files and folder setup that you'll be working with,

0:00:03.310,0:00:06.640
how are you going to actually write the CSS to define your framework?

0:00:06.640,0:00:10.940
I suggested using a 12 column grid because it's really easy to create all of

0:00:10.940,0:00:13.980
the columns that you need, but what else do you think you'll need to define?

0:00:13.980,0:00:19.160
Well you'll need to create a CSS class that includes a row of 100% page width,

0:00:19.160,0:00:22.970
a CSS class for a row of one-twelfth of the page width.

0:00:22.970,0:00:25.790
Remember, 12 here is coming from the number of columns.

0:00:25.790,0:00:30.710
Will we only need to create one column class of one-twelfths of the page width,

0:00:30.710,0:00:32.250
to define our columns.

0:00:32.250,0:00:36.360
Will we need to create multiple columns of everything between 1 over 12 and

0:00:36.360,0:00:38.420
12 over 12 page widths.

0:00:38.420,0:00:43.366
That means we'll need to create a column class for 1 over 12 page widths, 1 for

0:00:43.366,0:00:47.236
2 over 12 page widths, 1 for 3 over 12 page widths, 1 for

0:00:47.236,0:00:51.822
4 over 12 page widths and so on, or will we only need to create columns of 2

0:00:51.822,0:00:57.060
over 12, 3 over 12 and 4 over 12 page widths to create our framework.

0:00:57.060,0:00:58.490
Oh and by the way,

0:00:58.490,0:01:03.300
the reason I put these dots here is because when you're writing CSS you'll need

0:01:03.300,0:01:06.680
to identify that something is a class by putting a dot in front of it.

0:01:06.680,0:01:08.830
So it's good to get used to that notation now.

0:01:08.830,0:01:12.420
Think about this question, and when you're done check all that apply.
