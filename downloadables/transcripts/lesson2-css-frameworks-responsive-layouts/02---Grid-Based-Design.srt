Our eyes naturally follow patterns when we look at things.

0:00:03.580,0:00:04.900
We usually start in the top left,

0:00:04.900,0:00:09.560
and then we'll look from left to right, and then top to bottom.

0:00:09.560,0:00:13.010
Traditional print media takes advantage of the patterns our eyes follow, and so

0:00:13.010,0:00:14.220
do websites.

0:00:14.220,0:00:15.510
For instance, with our website here,

0:00:15.510,0:00:18.210
we have the title at the top because we want the title to

0:00:18.210,0:00:21.160
be the first thing that people see when they click on our website.

0:00:21.160,0:00:24.970
After they get past the title, they'll move down and at the left we have images.

0:00:24.970,0:00:26.680
These images are here to capture attention,

0:00:26.680,0:00:28.230
because people will look at the images first.

0:00:28.230,0:00:30.650
Then they'll see the headline.

0:00:30.650,0:00:33.800
And then once they read the headline, they'll go down to the text below it.

0:00:33.800,0:00:37.080
This type of design follows what we call a grid based layout, and

0:00:37.080,0:00:40.700
in fact many if not all websites, follow a grid based layout.

0:00:40.700,0:00:42.290
Here we are on the Udacity course's page.

0:00:42.290,0:00:45.410
It's pretty easy to pick out the grid on this page.

0:00:45.410,0:00:46.660
We can see that there's a main column on

0:00:46.660,0:00:49.890
the left that's broken into smaller grids, and then on the right,

0:00:49.890,0:00:53.310
we have this large column that's broken into smaller grids.

0:00:53.310,0:00:57.040
In fact, we can keep breaking it down into smaller and smaller grids.

0:00:57.040,0:01:00.110
Other websites like the New York Times do the same thing.

0:01:00.110,0:01:03.070
It's pretty easy to see how the New York Times is broken into grids.

0:01:03.070,0:01:06.020
And we can keep going breaking it into smaller and smaller pieces of the grid.

0:01:06.020,0:01:09.190
Next time you're on a website, try to break it apart into grids.

0:01:09.190,0:01:10.550
You'll be surprised how easy it is.
