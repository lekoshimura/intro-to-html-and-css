0:00:00.410,0:00:01.950
Let's start with Play.

0:00:01.950,0:00:05.280
On Google Fonts, I search for Play and we see it here.

0:00:05.280,0:00:08.710
This looks sort of similar, but not close enough for me.

0:00:08.710,0:00:10.720
All right, let's check out Rambla.

0:00:10.720,0:00:13.290
I search for Rambla and we see this here.

0:00:13.290,0:00:16.260
Once again, it's close but mm, not quite.

0:00:16.260,0:00:17.830
Next up, Lato.

0:00:17.830,0:00:19.300
Mm, Lato's looking really good.

0:00:20.470,0:00:24.350
I'm not 100%, so let's check the last one, and then we'll come back to this.

0:00:24.350,0:00:26.200
Finally we've got Arbitron.

0:00:26.200,0:00:29.460
I've searched for Arbitron and that is definitely not it.

0:00:29.460,0:00:31.100
So it looks like Lato's the winner.

0:00:31.100,0:00:33.370
Lets add it to the website and see how it looks.

0:00:33.370,0:00:34.525
I'll click here.

0:00:34.525,0:00:36.840
I'll scroll down and copy this.

0:00:36.840,0:00:42.170
Inside the website I'll replace the sample here with the code for Lato and save

0:00:42.170,0:00:47.220
it, and now we just need to make sure we've got the right styles in our CSS.

0:00:47.220,0:00:52.640
So I'll copy this, come over to our CSS, and paste it in here.

0:00:52.640,0:00:55.840
So now, everything in the page should have Lato as the font.

0:00:55.840,0:00:59.640
We'll save it, come over to Chrome, and refresh the page.

0:00:59.640,0:01:00.780
Aha.

0:01:00.780,0:01:01.940
That's looking pretty good.

0:01:01.940,0:01:03.300
Let's compare it to the mock up.

0:01:03.300,0:01:06.220
Comparing our page to what we had in the mock up, we can see that

0:01:06.220,0:01:09.730
they're really, really similar but they're not quite exactly the same.

0:01:09.730,0:01:13.250
And that's because we have a few options that we need to play with.

0:01:13.250,0:01:15.850
I'm going to leave this as an exercise for you.

0:01:15.850,0:01:19.360
Come back into Google Fonts and start playing with how thick the lines are and

0:01:19.360,0:01:21.130
make sure that everything's in the right case, and

0:01:21.130,0:01:24.240
you should see this font look just like the design mock up.

0:01:24.240,0:01:25.820
So the correct answer here is Lato.
