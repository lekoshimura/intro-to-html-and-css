>> Cameron just showed you how to solve problems based on solutions developed by

0:00:03.820,0:00:04.551
other people.

0:00:04.551,0:00:06.903
Now this is a common practice in web development.

0:00:06.903,0:00:08.256
So let's ask Jacques and

0:00:08.256,0:00:12.320
see how he approaches problem solving in his everyday work.

0:00:12.320,0:00:14.258
I've got this broccoli stuffed animal.

0:00:14.258,0:00:15.961
Let's see if we can get his attention.

0:00:22.231,0:00:26.044
>> So problem solving on the web is not exactly fun.

0:00:26.044,0:00:28.423
But when you run into an issue with HTML or CSS,

0:00:28.423,0:00:32.327
the chances that somebody else has run into that same issue are pretty good,

0:00:32.327,0:00:34.404
especially when you're starting out.

0:00:34.404,0:00:38.080
So checking sites like Stack Overflow.

0:00:38.080,0:00:40.060
Searching around on the web for

0:00:41.270,0:00:43.780
sort of the same type of problem you're experiencing.

0:00:43.780,0:00:44.813
This doesn't fit over that.

0:00:44.813,0:00:47.680
Why is this shifting down below here?

0:00:47.680,0:00:54.150
Those sorts of things will most times yield the answer you're looking for.

0:00:54.150,0:00:57.360
One of the great things about the fact that there are so many people doing web

0:00:57.360,0:01:01.610
development is that those people run into the same types of problems.

0:01:01.610,0:01:02.960
So go check Stack Overflow.

0:01:02.960,0:01:03.970
Go check out the web.

0:01:03.970,0:01:06.210
You can probably find the answer that you're looking for.
