Once you've figured out the structure of your HTML,

0:00:03.060,0:00:06.080
you can start to think about things like semantic tags.

0:00:06.080,0:00:08.880
Or tags that not only make sense to the browser, but

0:00:08.880,0:00:11.040
also make sense to any humans looking at them.

0:00:11.040,0:00:14.308
These include things like Header 1 through 4, indicated by H1,

0:00:14.308,0:00:17.870
H2, H3, H4, images, and forms.

0:00:17.870,0:00:20.850
For instance, Header one tags are more prominent and

0:00:20.850,0:00:24.670
organize larger pieces of information than say H4 tags,

0:00:24.670,0:00:28.020
which are going to organizing more specific pieces of information.

0:00:28.020,0:00:30.970
When you're working on a page it's important to ask if any text

0:00:30.970,0:00:31.990
needs to stand out.

0:00:31.990,0:00:36.090
And then if it does, use some semantic tags to style it appropriately.

0:00:36.090,0:00:39.840
Which semantic tags would you use to style the red box containing the name at

0:00:39.840,0:00:42.980
the top, the blue box containing featured work, and

0:00:42.980,0:00:46.140
the three green boxes containing the titles of our projects?

0:00:46.140,0:00:47.010
