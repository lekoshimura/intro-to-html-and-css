Now it's time for you to go create a folder structure for your project.

0:00:04.470,0:00:06.900
Inside, you're going to need a CSS file for

0:00:06.900,0:00:11.380
your framework, and you'll also need a test.html file.

0:00:11.380,0:00:14.880
The structure you create for your portfolio folder should look something like

0:00:14.880,0:00:18.840
this, and you can use the structure you created in the last lesson.

0:00:18.840,0:00:20.370
Make sure that you have a folder for

0:00:20.370,0:00:23.030
your CSS files, because we might need more than one.

0:00:23.030,0:00:24.890
In large products that's pretty common,

0:00:24.890,0:00:28.170
so it's a good idea to have this organization from the very beginning.

0:00:28.170,0:00:31.180
I'm going to do two things to make sure this is correct.

0:00:31.180,0:00:34.990
First off I'm going to create a style in main.css which is going to be

0:00:34.990,0:00:36.960
linked in test.html.

0:00:36.960,0:00:41.300
Then I'll open up test.html with some code in it, just to test.

0:00:41.300,0:00:43.455
And we'll make sure that those CSS styles and

0:00:43.455,0:00:46.348
main.css are applying to test.html.

0:00:46.348,0:00:50.830
Within test.html I created a link to main.css,

0:00:50.830,0:00:53.670
which is of course within the css directory.

0:00:53.670,0:00:59.060
Inside the body I added framework Test Page, and I included it within an h1 tag.

0:00:59.060,0:01:03.520
In main.css, to make sure it's working, I changed the color of the h1 tag to

0:01:03.520,0:01:09.110
green, so we should see the text framework test page show up in a page in green.

0:01:09.110,0:01:09.640
Let's take a look.

0:01:10.700,0:01:12.090
So I'm over in the browser.

0:01:12.090,0:01:18.480
I go to File > Open, which lets me open this test.html file.

0:01:18.480,0:01:23.130
I'll click Open, and here we see, framework test page show up in green.

0:01:23.130,0:01:25.960
Let's just triple check to make sure this is right.

0:01:25.960,0:01:29.700
Let's change the color to blue and see if it works.

0:01:29.700,0:01:33.430
Save, come back over, I will hit refresh, and now,

0:01:33.430,0:01:35.190
framework test page is in blue.

0:01:35.190,0:01:38.930
So we know we've got our HTML and CSS files in the right place.

0:01:38.930,0:01:42.460
Now, I want you to set up your folder structure and files.

0:01:42.460,0:01:44.920
When you're done, it should look like what you see here.

0:01:44.920,0:01:46.550
Check this box when you're ready to move on.
