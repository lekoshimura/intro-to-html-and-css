0:00:00.150,0:00:01.790
Okay, so I've got the website open.

0:00:01.790,0:00:02.400
Let's go ahead and

0:00:02.400,0:00:04.950
try it out in dev tools, I'll open it up by pressing Cmd+Option+I and

0:00:04.950,0:00:08.700
let's go ahead and just select one of these rows.

0:00:08.700,0:00:11.150
Sure, row and here we go.

0:00:11.150,0:00:13.570
Now I'm going to answer this a little bit out of order.

0:00:13.570,0:00:15.230
We should see changes immediately.

0:00:15.230,0:00:16.980
As soon as we start typing in here.

0:00:16.980,0:00:19.960
So display and the first one was block.

0:00:19.960,0:00:23.620
Press Enter and it looks like nothing happened up here.

0:00:23.620,0:00:25.950
Okay, so I'm not feeling too good about block.

0:00:25.950,0:00:26.800
Let's try float.

0:00:26.800,0:00:29.100
We'll just go ahead and jump to that.

0:00:29.100,0:00:32.590
Go to F-L-O-A-T and press Enter.

0:00:32.590,0:00:35.980
Oh, okay so that's being invalidated by something.

0:00:35.980,0:00:37.650
Okay. So that's not working.

0:00:37.650,0:00:40.940
Let's try instead, display flex.

0:00:40.940,0:00:41.600
Hey, hey.

0:00:41.600,0:00:43.070
And look at that.

0:00:43.070,0:00:45.230
As soon as we do it, our columns look right.

0:00:45.230,0:00:46.720
2 and 10 are lined up.

0:00:46.720,0:00:47.940
3 and 9 are lined up.

0:00:47.940,0:00:48.930
4, 4, 4.

0:00:48.930,0:00:52.110
They're acting like we expected them to.

0:00:52.110,0:00:55.600
And of course, we can also add flex wrap, wrap.

0:00:55.600,0:00:57.400
And it still looks good.

0:00:57.400,0:00:58.720
To learn more about flex and

0:00:58.720,0:01:01.290
the way it works, check out the link in the instructor notes.

0:01:01.290,0:01:05.360
This means that display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap, is the correct answer.
