0:00:00.180,0:00:02.530
The overall layout of your page should look fine right now,

0:00:02.530,0:00:04.390
but it doesn't quite look right.

0:00:04.390,0:00:07.070
For starters, we don't actually have images here.

0:00:07.070,0:00:09.870
Of course, you could use the images that are in the design mock up.

0:00:09.870,0:00:13.200
But that doesn't make much sense because those aren't images of

0:00:13.200,0:00:15.110
your actual projects.

0:00:15.110,0:00:18.850
In situations like this, it makes sense to have some type of place holder image.

0:00:18.850,0:00:22.270
Right here, we have place holder images that simply show how large they are.

0:00:22.270,0:00:24.550
Right now, I'm using placehold.it,

0:00:24.550,0:00:28.750
which is an awesome website that makes really fast and easy placeholder images.

0:00:28.750,0:00:31.570
Each image simply has its dimensions printed inside it.

0:00:31.570,0:00:35.590
To use images from placehold.it, simply follow the pattern here.

0:00:35.590,0:00:40.230
It's just an image that starts with placehold.it/ and then the dimensions.

0:00:40.230,0:00:41.110
Inside the source code for

0:00:41.110,0:00:44.030
the website, we can see a lot of links using placehold.it.

0:00:44.030,0:00:45.210
Let's see if it works.

0:00:45.210,0:00:50.310
I'm going to change this image from 960 by 350 to 1,000 by 350,

0:00:50.310,0:00:52.640
and I will save it.

0:00:52.640,0:00:55.380
So when I refresh the page, we should see that this turns into 1,000 by 350.

0:00:55.380,0:00:59.060
And there we go, the image is a little bit larger.

0:00:59.060,0:01:01.410
Of course, these are pretty boring and

0:01:01.410,0:01:03.180
it's important to have fun while your working.

0:01:03.180,0:01:05.745
So, instead of using placehold.it there are other services.

0:01:05.745,0:01:10.940
Placepuppy.it is an even more fun way of including placeholder images.

0:01:10.940,0:01:12.610
Look at those cute dogs.

0:01:12.610,0:01:13.150
Oh my god.

0:01:13.150,0:01:14.207
They're so cute.

0:01:14.207,0:01:20.510
[LAUGH] Oh, yeah, anyways you can use placepuppy.it/ the dimensions here and

0:01:20.510,0:01:22.160
you could also include these in the page.

0:01:22.160,0:01:23.070
Let's give one a shot.

0:01:23.070,0:01:23.940
We'll come back to here.

0:01:23.940,0:01:29.753
And instead of placehold.it, let's make it placepuppy.it and

0:01:29.753,0:01:34.620
1000 by 350 and we'll save it and let's come back to our demo.

0:01:34.620,0:01:35.905
And when we hit refresh,

0:01:35.905,0:01:40.200
[LAUGH] we, we have the top of a dachshund staring at us and it's adorable.

0:01:40.200,0:01:42.830
So, that's another way of making your life a little bit more fun.

0:01:42.830,0:01:45.990
But for those of you who aren't dog lovers, there's also kittens.

0:01:45.990,0:01:49.520
Adding cats to the website is as easy as using placekitten.com.

0:01:49.520,0:01:52.850
And it follows pretty similar syntax to, placepuppy.it.

0:01:52.850,0:01:53.927
Cats make me allergic.

0:01:53.927,0:01:55.200
So I'm not going to use them.

0:01:55.200,0:01:56.784
But, all right, you know, you know what?

0:01:56.784,0:01:58.570
Tell you what, let's try one out.

0:01:58.570,0:01:59.263
All right.

0:01:59.263,0:02:02.050
So placekitten.com/ the dimensions.

0:02:02.050,0:02:05.647
So let's, instead of placepuppy let's make it placekitten.com.

0:02:05.647,0:02:09.270
So we have placekitten.com instead of placepuppy.it.

0:02:09.270,0:02:11.960
And we have the same dimensions.

0:02:11.960,0:02:16.500
And when we refresh the page, now we have an adorable cat starring at us.

0:02:16.500,0:02:17.760
So, you've got options for

0:02:17.760,0:02:20.320
making your life a lot more fun when your building websites.

0:02:20.320,0:02:23.730
Which of the following placeholder images do you prefer using?

0:02:23.730,0:02:24.240
None.

0:02:24.240,0:02:28.110
Because using the real images is probably the best strategy.

0:02:28.110,0:02:32.550
Or do you like using placehold.it, because seeing dimensions is really helpful?

0:02:32.550,0:02:36.240
Do you like placepuppy.it because seeing dogs just makes your day better?

0:02:36.240,0:02:39.660
Or do you think that kittens with placekitten.com is the way to go?

0:02:39.660,0:02:41.880
If none of these type your answer in here and

0:02:41.880,0:02:43.080
let us know which one you like using.
