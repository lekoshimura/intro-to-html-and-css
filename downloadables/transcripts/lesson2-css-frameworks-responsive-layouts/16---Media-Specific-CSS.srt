0:00:00.310,0:00:04.688
All right, let's start off with media only screen in max-width 500.

0:00:04.688,0:00:09.480
In my main.css file I've added media only screen and max-width 500.

0:00:09.480,0:00:12.900
Okay, I've refreshed the page and let's make it smaller.

0:00:12.900,0:00:13.630
Oh, there we go.

0:00:13.630,0:00:16.260
As soon as we got below 500 pixels it disappeared.

0:00:16.260,0:00:17.840
So that one looks like it's working.

0:00:17.840,0:00:21.620
Next up we've got media only screen with max-width 500 and

0:00:21.620,0:00:23.710
this orientation landscape.

0:00:23.710,0:00:26.544
Now orientation here is referring to phone orientations,

0:00:26.544,0:00:29.610
whether it's turned in landscape mode or portrait mode.

0:00:29.610,0:00:31.530
We'll save main.css.

0:00:31.530,0:00:32.740
We'll refresh Chrome.

0:00:32.740,0:00:33.970
And let's see.

0:00:33.970,0:00:34.570
Aha!

0:00:34.570,0:00:36.490
And that one's also working.

0:00:36.490,0:00:39.440
Now we've got media only screen, and min-width 500.

0:00:39.440,0:00:41.610
Okay, let's see.

0:00:41.610,0:00:44.620
Oh, and as soon as I refresh the page, it disappeared.

0:00:44.620,0:00:47.600
That's because this screen is bigger than 500 pixels,

0:00:47.600,0:00:51.090
which means that that media query got hit in paragraphs are being hidden.

0:00:51.090,0:00:55.110
Last but not least, we have media only print and with a max-width of 500.

0:00:55.110,0:00:58.240
Now print here means that these styles are only going to be

0:00:58.240,0:00:59.329
used if it's being printed.

0:01:00.480,0:01:02.240
So we'll save the page.

0:01:02.240,0:01:03.680
We'll refresh.

0:01:03.680,0:01:04.510
And here it is.

0:01:04.510,0:01:06.750
Let's make the screen smaller to see if it disappears.

0:01:08.040,0:01:09.460
And it does not.

0:01:09.460,0:01:10.340
We're not printing so

0:01:10.340,0:01:14.540
this paragraph's going to stay even if the screen is smaller than 500 pixels.

0:01:14.540,0:01:16.660
So looking at the question.

0:01:16.660,0:01:21.120
The first one made paragraphs disappear for screens smaller than 500 pixels.

0:01:21.120,0:01:23.800
As do the second, but the third and fourth didn't.
