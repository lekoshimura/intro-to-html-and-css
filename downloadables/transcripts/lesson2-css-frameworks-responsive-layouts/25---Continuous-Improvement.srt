Once the layout is mostly done,

0:00:01.330,0:00:04.678
you can start dealing with all the fun visual stuff like the background colors,

0:00:04.678,0:00:08.460
the margins, the padding, the borders, the fonts, etc.

0:00:08.460,0:00:11.620
Colors and margins are pretty easy to test with Dev tools as we've seen so

0:00:11.620,0:00:13.280
far, but what about fonts?

0:00:13.280,0:00:16.230
How do you find a font that looks close enough to the one that was

0:00:16.230,0:00:17.720
provided in the design?

0:00:17.720,0:00:21.900
There's really no super easy way to do that apart from asking the designer to

0:00:21.900,0:00:25.360
kindly use the free web fonts and then tell you which one they used.

0:00:25.360,0:00:28.675
That might not work however, so you might be left with the task of going

0:00:28.675,0:00:32.710
online to find the closest web font that matches what you had in the design and

0:00:32.710,0:00:36.640
one of the best places to get fonts is with Google at Google.com/fonts.

0:00:36.640,0:00:40.190
It's fun to go on here and just browse around to see what you can find.

0:00:40.190,0:00:42.100
You can look around, you can filter, and

0:00:42.100,0:00:45.290
then find a font that looks closest to what you're given in the design.

0:00:45.290,0:00:46.260
All right, I like this one.

0:00:46.260,0:00:48.600
It looks kind of close to my handwriting, but not really.

0:00:48.600,0:00:52.910
Anyways, let's click on this and we can go ahead and add it to our website.

0:00:52.910,0:00:55.780
We'll scroll down and then all we have to do is add this code.

0:00:55.780,0:00:56.920
So I'll click on it and

0:00:56.920,0:01:00.990
copy it and then we'll come up here to the head of our document and paste it in.

0:01:00.990,0:01:04.819
So the link that we just copied from Google tells browsers to download the font,

0:01:04.819,0:01:08.840
but we still need to go into CSS and make sure the font is actually being used.

0:01:08.840,0:01:11.770
Back in the Google Fonts page, I'm just going to go ahead and

0:01:11.770,0:01:15.940
copy this code right here, and I'll past this into our CSS file.

0:01:15.940,0:01:18.750
In this case, I'm applying the font family Indie Flower,

0:01:18.750,0:01:21.840
which we are going to download to everything on the page,

0:01:21.840,0:01:24.270
and we know it's everything because of this asterisk.

0:01:24.270,0:01:27.180
So I'll save the CSS and let's reload the page.

0:01:27.180,0:01:30.760
When I hit refresh, we should see this font change and there we go.

0:01:30.760,0:01:33.000
Our new font has now been applied to the page.

0:01:33.000,0:01:35.620
Scrolling down, we should see it on everything.

0:01:35.620,0:01:38.250
There we go, our featured work, appify, appify, and

0:01:38.250,0:01:40.600
appify all have the cool new font now.

0:01:40.600,0:01:41.810
Play around with Google fonts for

0:01:41.810,0:01:44.120
a bit and then see if you can answer this question.

0:01:44.120,0:01:48.120
Which of these fonts is closest to the font that we see in the mock up?

0:01:48.120,0:01:51.780
Is it Play, Rambla, Lato, or Orbitron?
