Starting with the red box up at the top,

0:00:03.000,0:00:05.689
we want our names to be as prominent as possible.

0:00:06.700,0:00:10.210
Looking at featured work here, it's important to note that despite the fact it

0:00:10.210,0:00:13.720
doesn't quite look as prominent as the titles of our projects,

0:00:13.720,0:00:16.900
it is organizing our projects, making it more important.

0:00:16.900,0:00:19.630
So let's put featured work in an H2 tag.

0:00:19.630,0:00:23.180
Coming to the project titles at the bottom of the portfolio, they're not as

0:00:23.180,0:00:28.290
important as featured work or the name at the top, so let's make them H3 tags.
