There's still a lot of details on the page that you're going to need to

0:00:02.380,0:00:04.790
tweak before it looks exactly like the design mock up.

0:00:04.790,0:00:08.740
And you should continue to tweak to make this portfolio page your own.

0:00:08.740,0:00:12.950
At this point, it makes sense to get into the Code, Test, Refine process for

0:00:12.950,0:00:14.420
building your portfolio.

0:00:14.420,0:00:16.190
Code part of the portfolio.

0:00:16.190,0:00:18.540
Test your code by opening the page in the browser.

0:00:18.540,0:00:21.470
And then refine your code once you see what's right and what's wrong.

0:00:21.470,0:00:24.230
Then keep coding, keep testing, and keep refining.

0:00:24.230,0:00:27.760
My suggestion is to start off by making the layout look as much like the mock up

0:00:27.760,0:00:31.000
as possible, and once you're happy with the layout, start customizing it.

0:00:31.000,0:00:33.720
You can change the CSS or really, whatever you want.

0:00:33.720,0:00:36.860
Because this is your portfolio and it should show off you.

0:00:36.860,0:00:39.730
When you finish customizing, check this box to let us know that

0:00:39.730,0:00:42.200
you're happy with the way your portfolio looks.

0:00:42.200,0:00:45.350
Then, think back to the process of building the portfolio.

0:00:45.350,0:00:46.880
What was the hardest part for you?

Good luck.

Jessica and I really can't wait to see your portfolios when you finish.
