0:00:00.090,0:00:02.180
Finally, we can start writing the page.

0:00:02.180,0:00:04.710
But before we do, we need some kind of convention for

0:00:04.710,0:00:07.750
how we're going to name all of the columns in our grid, so

0:00:07.750,0:00:10.020
we can easily remember them later when we want to use them.

0:00:10.020,0:00:12.910
First off, we need a name for this entire row.

0:00:12.910,0:00:15.340
And for that, I think it makes sense to just call it a row.

0:00:15.340,0:00:16.890
No need to make things complicated.

0:00:16.890,0:00:19.200
Now we need names for all of the columns here.

0:00:19.200,0:00:21.520
Or for elements of different column widths.

0:00:21.520,0:00:23.510
First one we'll do, well, column one.

0:00:23.510,0:00:24.030
Why not?

0:00:24.030,0:00:26.480
It's one column wide, so we'll just call it column one.

0:00:26.480,0:00:30.230
If we want element to be two columns wide, we'll call it column-2.

0:00:30.230,0:00:32.229
To indicate that it's two columns wide.

0:00:32.229,0:00:36.120
Same thing for column three, that is three columns wide.

0:00:36.120,0:00:40.430
And so on until we get to column 12, which is the full width of the row.

0:00:40.430,0:00:42.250
This makes our lives pretty easy.

0:00:42.250,0:00:45.720
Let's imagine we wanted something to be a quarter of the full width wide.

0:00:45.720,0:00:48.510
A quarter of 12 is three, so we simply need to give that

0:00:48.510,0:00:53.070
element a class of column three to make sure it's a quarter of this entire row.

0:00:53.070,0:00:55.240
Let's go ahead and set this up in our CSS file.

0:00:55.240,0:00:56.610
First, we'll set up some borders so

0:00:56.610,0:00:59.480
we can easily see where our elements are on the screen.

0:00:59.480,0:01:01.710
And then let's set up some box sizing.

0:01:01.710,0:01:03.120
Then we'll define our row.

0:01:03.120,0:01:05.740
Remember, each row should take up the entire width of the screen.

0:01:05.740,0:01:07.480
So we'll set it to width 100%.

0:01:07.480,0:01:11.120
After row, we'll set up the width of all of our columns.

0:01:11.120,0:01:12.870
You'll see column one, column two,

0:01:12.870,0:01:15.790
column three, just like we decided to do before.

0:01:15.790,0:01:18.370
And each width is set to a percentage of the page.

0:01:18.370,0:01:20.310
Column one is one twelfth of the page.

0:01:20.310,0:01:22.680
Column two is two twelfth of the page.

0:01:22.680,0:01:25.430
Column three is twelfths of the page and so on.

0:01:25.430,0:01:29.540
Now that we've got our CSS set, let's get a sample page to see if this works.

0:01:29.540,0:01:32.970
In the instructor notes, you'll find the HTML that you see right here.

0:01:32.970,0:01:37.170
And notice that we've gotten outer class of row, and then, two inner columns.

0:01:37.170,0:01:38.690
Column 2 and column 10.

0:01:38.690,0:01:41.420
So together, they should fill up the entire row.

0:01:41.420,0:01:42.450
Then we have column 3 and

0:01:42.450,0:01:47.210
column 9, 3 plus 9 is 12 so these two columns should also fill up this row.

0:01:47.210,0:01:48.302
Let's see if it works.

0:01:48.302,0:01:52.780
Opening test.html in the browser and we see this.

0:01:52.780,0:01:53.700
Hm.

0:01:53.700,0:01:55.110
Something doesn't look right.

0:01:55.110,0:01:56.660
So we can see column 2 and

0:01:56.660,0:02:00.380
column 10, but it looks like they're stacked on top of each other.

0:02:00.380,0:02:02.140
They're not lining up next to each other.

0:02:02.140,0:02:03.750
Same thing for 3 and 9.

0:02:03.750,0:02:04.750
Three 4's.

0:02:04.750,0:02:07.490
3, 6, 3. Each one of these should just fill up one row.

0:02:07.490,0:02:09.759
But instead, the columns are stacked on top of each other.

0:02:09.759,0:02:11.540
It looks like we've got a problem here.

0:02:11.540,0:02:15.750
What style should we add to the row class of CSS to fix the way

0:02:15.750,0:02:16.520
the columns are behaving?

0:02:16.520,0:02:18.690
Should we add display block?

0:02:18.690,0:02:23.420
Should we add display flex and flex wrap, wrap, or just display float?

0:02:23.420,0:02:26.570
The easiest way to figure this out is to open up dev tools and

0:02:26.570,0:02:29.380
add these CSS styles to the row class
