If you've been on the internet for a few years you've probably noticed that

0:00:03.350,0:00:07.250
some websites look or act differently on different browsers.

0:00:07.250,0:00:10.910
And trying to open a modern website on an older browser sometimes yields

0:00:10.910,0:00:12.330
a buggy experience.

0:00:12.330,0:00:15.430
Obviously as web developers we want to ensure that our users have

0:00:15.430,0:00:20.050
the same awesome experience regardless of their browsers or operating systems.

0:00:20.050,0:00:22.300
This has been a problem since the beginning of the web and

0:00:22.300,0:00:25.760
there are solutions available to manage cross-browser compatibility.

0:00:25.760,0:00:26.470
If you search for

0:00:26.470,0:00:32.119
CSS resetting or CSS normalize, you'll run into this style sheet, normalize.css.

0:00:32.119,0:00:33.730
Let's take a look at it.

0:00:33.730,0:00:36.780
This will help ensure that your CSS styles are interpreted the same

0:00:36.780,0:00:38.040
across all browsers.

0:00:38.040,0:00:42.210
To take advantage of CSS resetting, simply link to the CSS style you see here,

0:00:42.210,0:00:43.100
like so, and

0:00:43.100,0:00:46.010
you can be confident that your styles will work the same across all browsers.
