Okay. So now, we have our freshly printed website.

0:00:21.256,0:00:23.762
I'm going to go ahead and clean things up a little bit, so

0:00:23.762,0:00:25.971
we're only looking at what our mock up should be.

0:00:25.971,0:00:29.036
Get rid of these extra colors and get rid of this extra margin on the side.

0:00:29.036,0:00:29.604
[SOUND] So

0:00:29.604,0:00:34.560
now, I'm going to go ahead and cut this up into a bunch of different boxes.

0:00:34.560,0:00:38.206
So you can see to start out, we have three main boxes.

0:00:38.206,0:00:39.907
One for our header.

0:00:39.907,0:00:43.929
One for the middle image and one for the bottom images.

0:00:43.929,0:00:50.697
[SOUND] But there's actually a lot

0:00:50.697,0:00:57.760
more than just three boxes here.

0:00:57.760,0:01:01.300
Looking at the header again, we have two more boxes.

0:01:01.300,0:01:06.283
One for the you and another for our name and title.

0:01:06.283,0:01:07.881
So let's cut those out.

0:01:12.725,0:01:15.338
We still have our single image in the middle here.

0:01:15.338,0:01:20.206
But looking at our bottom featured work section, we actually have another box

0:01:20.206,0:01:24.720
for our header and then three more boxes around our images and captions.

0:01:31.280,0:01:34.960
And you could actually keep cutting these up into more boxes.

0:01:34.960,0:01:37.750
We have another box around our images.

0:01:37.750,0:01:39.930
Another box around our titles.

0:01:39.930,0:01:42.004
Another around the URLs.

0:01:42.004,0:01:45.234
But my hand is kind of cramping from all that cutting, so

0:01:45.234,0:01:46.831
I'm just going to stop here.

0:01:48.170,0:01:52.870
Now as we just saw, I printed out the page and I cut it up with scissors.

0:01:52.870,0:01:57.090
But obviously, you could have done any of these and it would have worked out.

0:01:57.090,0:02:02.580
And you also should have found between 9 and 20 boxes depending on

0:02:02.580,0:02:06.500
how deep you went and how much you just love drawing boxes around things
