>> Hey, there and welcome to the course.

0:00:02.400,0:00:03.570
I'm Jessica Olman.

0:00:03.570,0:00:04.950
>> And I'm Cameron Pittman.

0:00:04.950,0:00:07.120
We're going to be your instructors for this course.

0:00:07.120,0:00:10.244
>> Now, you're probably wondering why this course is

0:00:10.244,0:00:13.021
called Not Your Typical Intro to HTML and CSS.

0:00:13.021,0:00:15.793
That's because we're not going to show you how to

0:00:15.793,0:00:18.713
make a web page with a title and some body to start.

0:00:18.713,0:00:21.471
Instead, we're going to show you a methodical way of

0:00:21.471,0:00:25.460
breaking down a current web page and recreating it for your own purposes.

0:00:26.890,0:00:30.326
>> Hm, you know, HTML and CSS develop and change over time.

0:00:30.326,0:00:32.820
But the underlying principles will always remain the same.

0:00:32.820,0:00:34.319
Once you get a hang of those,

0:00:34.319,0:00:37.704
learning the specific techniques is going to become a lot easier.

0:00:37.704,0:00:41.773
In the first lesson, you'll learn how to look at a basic design mockup and

0:00:41.773,0:00:44.810
translate it to HTML and CSS to create a basic web page.

0:00:44.810,0:00:48.760
>> And in the second lesson, you'll develop a CSS framework,

0:00:48.760,0:00:52.566
which will help you make websites much faster and easier.

0:00:52.566,0:00:56.154
Along the way, you'll learn about responsive design, which is a principle that

0:00:56.154,0:00:59.700
will help you reach people on any device that they're using to see your website.

0:00:59.700,0:01:03.775
In the last lesson, you'll be taking on a professional framework.

0:01:03.775,0:01:07.417
You'll be building a static website using Twitter's Bootstrap framework,

0:01:07.417,0:01:11.000
which is what professionals use in the field every day.

0:01:11.000,0:01:13.880
>> Now, this course is just the beginning of your journey to

0:01:13.880,0:01:16.600
become a front-end web developer.

0:01:16.600,0:01:20.723
Here you'll build the foundations of your own online portfolio.

0:01:20.723,0:01:22.630
>> We are really excited to have you.

0:01:22.630,0:01:24.610
So, welcome to class and let's get started
