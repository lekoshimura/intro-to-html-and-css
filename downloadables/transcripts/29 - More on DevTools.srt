Now developer tools can also be a really great help to

0:00:03.560,0:00:06.720
you during the code test refine routine.

0:00:06.720,0:00:09.230
You're able to test things on the fly and

0:00:09.230,0:00:14.280
see how it affects your page without actually changing the HTML and CSS files.

0:00:14.280,0:00:17.180
So for example with the header 1 here I can

0:00:17.180,0:00:21.570
easily change the font size to make it bigger or smaller.

0:00:21.570,0:00:25.400
I can change the font family say to Arial.

0:00:25.400,0:00:28.240
I can also change the background colors of things.

0:00:28.240,0:00:33.760
So, for example, say I might not have the hexadecimal color from the designer

0:00:33.760,0:00:39.440
but I just want to use the slider and find something that looks pretty close.

0:00:39.440,0:00:46.640
You can also click over to the Sources tab and see the code, in the same place.

0:00:46.640,0:00:50.230
And then also remember that you can reset any changes by just

0:00:50.230,0:00:51.360
clicking the Refresh button.

0:00:52.660,0:00:55.290
So go ahead and play around a bit with Dev Tools and

0:00:55.290,0:00:58.190
see what you can change, and then let me know.

0:00:58.190,0:01:00.760
Just how cool is it to play with Dev Tools?

0:01:02.230,0:01:06.500
Let me know on a scale from one to ten with one being

0:01:06.500,0:01:11.610
a total snooze fest and ten being totally awesome.

0:01:12.900,0:01:14.600
Personally, I hope you choose ten.
