0:00:00.430,0:00:01.950
Looking at the first one,

0:00:01.950,0:00:05.760
to wrap this row of portfolio items, we'll use the class row.

0:00:05.760,0:00:10.150
Now for the second, to just wrap one portfolio item,

0:00:10.150,0:00:13.620
because it covers half of the screen, we'll use col-md-6,

0:00:13.620,0:00:18.870
where 6 is half of 12, and this featured work takes up half the screen.
