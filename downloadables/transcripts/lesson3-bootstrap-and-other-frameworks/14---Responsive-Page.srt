Here we are inside the CSS documentation on Bootstrap's website.

0:00:03.960,0:00:07.700
Inside the images section, we find something about responsive images.

0:00:07.700,0:00:08.590
This is what we want.

0:00:08.590,0:00:10.980
We want our images to be responsive-friendly.

0:00:10.980,0:00:15.120
It looks like we only need to add the image responsive class to make sure our

0:00:15.120,0:00:17.120
images are, well, responsive.

0:00:17.120,0:00:18.190
Let's see if that works.

0:00:18.190,0:00:19.710
Let's go ahead and open up DevTools.

0:00:19.710,0:00:21.600
And I'll go ahead and try it out on this image.

0:00:21.600,0:00:22.470
Booting it up.

0:00:22.470,0:00:23.570
I've got image here.

0:00:23.570,0:00:26.900
I'll right-click on it, add attribute.

0:00:26.900,0:00:30.940
So we've applied the class image responsive to this image in particular.

0:00:30.940,0:00:33.910
Let's go ahead and resize the page and see if it works.

0:00:33.910,0:00:37.060
I will make it smaller, and smaller, and

0:00:37.060,0:00:39.238
smaller until we're about the size of mobile.

0:00:39.238,0:00:41.800
And because we've added that responsive image class,

0:00:41.800,0:00:45.770
you can see the entire image fitting within the width of this small frame.

0:00:45.770,0:00:48.684
So, the correct class is img-responsive.
