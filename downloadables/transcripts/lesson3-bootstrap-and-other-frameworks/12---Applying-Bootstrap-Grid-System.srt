0:00:00.340,0:00:01.310
So, this is what I've done.

0:00:02.410,0:00:06.930
You'll notice here that I had to add a new div with a container class.

0:00:06.930,0:00:11.100
This makes sure that the margins on the side of the screen look good.

0:00:11.100,0:00:13.130
Then, inside of the container we have our row.

0:00:13.130,0:00:16.290
And then finally the columns inside the row.

0:00:16.290,0:00:21.780
Scrolling down, we can see that each row has a total of 12 columns.

0:00:21.780,0:00:26.260
So for instance this row, with featured work, has column medium 12,

0:00:26.260,0:00:30.660
while the row below featured work contains two columns,

0:00:30.660,0:00:33.330
each one a class column medium 6.

0:00:33.330,0:00:35.950
Notice how we have multiple rows on the page.

0:00:35.950,0:00:39.820
For instance, we have a row here for featured work, and inside the row we have

0:00:39.820,0:00:44.340
column medium 12 because featured works takes up the entire width of the screen.

0:00:44.340,0:00:47.990
However, in the row that contains our two samples of work,

0:00:47.990,0:00:51.300
we have two columns, each of size six.

0:00:51.300,0:00:52.500
Six plus six is 12.

0:00:52.500,0:00:55.380
So, these two take up the entire row.

0:00:55.380,0:00:56.900
Coming back to our question,

0:00:56.900,0:01:02.940
we did need to add a container div outside of our rows, so that one is true.

0:01:02.940,0:01:06.230
We didn't need to add any new divs to organize columns in rows.

0:01:06.230,0:01:07.950
That was already done for us.

0:01:07.950,0:01:12.450
Inside of our rows, we did need to add new divs with columns to organize our

0:01:12.450,0:01:16.340
content, so this last one is also true.

0:01:16.340,0:01:19.430
