Let's explore the Bootstrap documentation for the grid system.

0:00:03.420,0:00:05.580
These first three lines are really important.

0:00:05.580,0:00:09.400
The first one says that all rows must be placed within a container or

0:00:09.400,0:00:10.450
a fluid container.

0:00:10.450,0:00:13.970
This allows them to have the right alignment and padding on the page.

0:00:13.970,0:00:17.690
We'll also be using rows to create horizontal groups of columns,

0:00:17.690,0:00:20.100
which means columns that are lined up one next to each other.

0:00:20.100,0:00:24.950
And this last point says that your content has to be inside of a column and

0:00:24.950,0:00:27.290
a column has to be inside of a row.

0:00:27.290,0:00:28.430
Back to our mockup.

0:00:28.430,0:00:32.490
We've gone ahead and put some boxes around the different elements on the page.

0:00:32.490,0:00:35.550
We have a container encompassing the entire page.

0:00:35.550,0:00:40.580
We've got a row right here in the middle that includes Appify and Sunflower.

0:00:40.580,0:00:43.960
And then Appify itself is just a single column inside this row.

0:00:43.960,0:00:45.520
You can see other examples.

0:00:45.520,0:00:47.630
For instance, at the top, we have a header.

0:00:47.630,0:00:48.760
That's going to be a row.

0:00:48.760,0:00:52.410
And inside of our row, we have two columns, one on the left and

0:00:52.410,0:00:52.940
one on the right.
