0:00:00.350,0:00:03.680
After you unzip the downloaded file, you can open it up and

0:00:03.680,0:00:05.630
see the file structure within it.

0:00:05.630,0:00:08.373
Notice how there are two versions of everything with the same name.

0:00:08.373,0:00:11.416
We have bootstrap-theme.css and

0:00:11.416,0:00:16.450
bootstrap-theme.min.css and the same goes for JavaScript.

0:00:16.450,0:00:20.710
When a user opens your Web page or rather, when their browsers open the Web

0:00:20.710,0:00:23.630
page, they'll have to download all of the style and

0:00:23.630,0:00:26.070
JavaScript files that you've included in it.

0:00:26.070,0:00:28.370
Sometimes these files can be quite large.

0:00:28.370,0:00:32.369
So to help avoid that problem, we use minified files.

0:00:32.369,0:00:33.580
Minified CSS and

0:00:33.580,0:00:37.660
JavaScript files take up less space and can be downloaded faster.

0:00:37.660,0:00:38.710
On the left side,

0:00:38.710,0:00:43.310
I've got the unminified, the normal version of bootstrap CSS file open.

0:00:43.310,0:00:46.100
Notice how it looks pretty normal, but on the right,

0:00:46.100,0:00:48.400
I've got the minified version of the same file.

0:00:48.400,0:00:52.010
These two files are the same, but all of the white space has been taken out of

0:00:52.010,0:00:56.030
the minified version, while on the unminified version, it is still readable.

0:00:56.030,0:00:59.450
You should always include the minified version of your files on your site so

0:00:59.450,0:01:01.070
they can be downloaded faster.

0:01:01.070,0:01:04.677
But when you're editing, you should definitely use the unminified version.

0:01:04.677,0:01:07.580
Otherwise, you'll drive yourself crazy trying to figure out what's going on.
