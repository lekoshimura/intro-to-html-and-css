0:00:00.260,0:00:02.750
Can you create a folder structure for the project?

0:00:02.750,0:00:03.700
Yes.

0:00:03.700,0:00:07.260
You don't need to know anything about the framework in order to create the HTML

0:00:07.260,0:00:09.700
and CSS files that you'll later be writing.

0:00:09.700,0:00:11.960
Can you create a DOM tree for the page?

0:00:11.960,0:00:12.690
Yes.

0:00:12.690,0:00:14.150
Using the structure of the mock-up,

0:00:14.150,0:00:17.040
you could pretty much figure out what the DOM tree should look like.

0:00:17.040,0:00:19.990
Can you write HTML that defines the DOM?

0:00:19.990,0:00:20.920
Yes, you can.

0:00:20.920,0:00:22.440
If you can figure out the DOM tree for

0:00:22.440,0:00:25.560
the page, you can start writing the HTML that will create it.

0:00:25.560,0:00:28.750
Can you assign class names to HTML Elements?

0:00:28.750,0:00:29.950
No you can't.

0:00:29.950,0:00:31.800
Not until you have your frame work picked out.

0:00:31.800,0:00:34.300
Each frame work will have its own custom classes.

0:00:34.300,0:00:36.090
Can you write CSS?

0:00:36.090,0:00:36.870
Not quite.

0:00:36.870,0:00:38.470
Not until you pick a framework.

0:00:38.470,0:00:40.000
And can you test the page?

0:00:40.000,0:00:43.300
Well if you don't have the CSS you're not going to be able to test it yet.
