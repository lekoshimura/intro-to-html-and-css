Okay so here I am inside DevTools for our page.

0:00:03.560,0:00:06.820
And I've got the div selected that has our name and title.

0:00:06.820,0:00:09.980
It looks like we're in the right place but let's go ahead and

0:00:09.980,0:00:14.040
check Bootstrap's documentation, to figure out which classes we need.

0:00:14.040,0:00:17.920
I found this section about alignment classes in the CSS documentation.

0:00:17.920,0:00:23.490
It looks like we just need to add text-right to get Right aligned text.

0:00:23.490,0:00:25.070
Let's go ahead and try that out.

0:00:25.070,0:00:26.380
I'm back in DevTools.

0:00:26.380,0:00:29.940
And I will, double-click on the class to open it up.

0:00:29.940,0:00:34.230
I'll type in text-right, and press Enter.

0:00:34.230,0:00:35.800
And we see that our name and

0:00:35.800,0:00:38.190
title immediately pop to the right side of the screen.

0:00:38.190,0:00:39.590
So it looks like we're on the right track.

0:00:39.590,0:00:41.170
Let's see if we can get it capitalized.

0:00:41.170,0:00:42.170
Right underneath alignment,

0:00:42.170,0:00:46.660
we see transformation classes, including Uppercased text.

0:00:46.660,0:00:48.970
All we need to do is add the class text-uppercase.

0:00:48.970,0:00:50.738
Let's see if it works.

0:00:50.738,0:00:55.460
So now we have text-right and text-uppercase and I'll press Enter, and voila!

0:00:55.460,0:00:58.400
We have capitalized text that is aligned on the right.

0:00:58.400,0:01:01.960
So for right-align text, we just need text-right.

0:01:01.960,0:01:05.590
And to make text uppercase we simply add text-uppercase.

0:01:05.590,0:01:10.200
It worked for us when we added these classes to class equals col-md-6, but

0:01:10.200,0:01:13.440
in fact you could also add it to the h1 and h3 tags.

0:01:14.440,0:01:17.150
While adding it to h1 and h3 would work,

0:01:17.150,0:01:19.830
it's actually a lot cleaner when you add it to the div containing them.
