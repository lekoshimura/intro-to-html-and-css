There are dozens of frame works besides Bootstrap available,

0:00:04.070,0:00:06.320
Foundation 4 by Zerb and

0:00:06.320,0:00:11.540
Yaml 4 by Derk Jesse, provide huge sets of features comparable to Bootstrap.

0:00:11.540,0:00:16.344
You'll find everything from responsive grid systems and nice looking buttons, to

0:00:16.344,0:00:21.060
Java script modules for interactive elements like drop down menus and carousels.

If you need simplicity other frameworks like 960 Grid, Susy and Frameless

provide their own grid systems without the overhead of additional features.

Bootstrap is currently one of the most popular frameworks and

0:00:33.930,0:00:35.460
actually that's why we're using it.

0:00:35.460,0:00:38.870
It does, however, include some advanced functionality you might never need.

0:00:38.870,0:00:43.010
The good news is that because it's so robust, after you've mastered Bootstrap

0:00:43.010,0:00:46.660
you'll be able to pick up other, simpler frameworks with very little effort.
