This mockup is pretty similar to the portfolio mockup you worked on

0:00:03.810,0:00:04.730
in the previous lesson.

0:00:04.730,0:00:06.570
There are some differences, however.

0:00:06.570,0:00:09.780
For example, the layout of the work examples and

0:00:09.780,0:00:13.110
the color scheme, particularly that of the background.

0:00:13.110,0:00:17.020
You can see the colors and the hex codes on the left hand side of the screen.

0:00:17.020,0:00:19.890
But you should always start with looking at the design, and,

0:00:19.890,0:00:22.030
as always, consider the structure.

0:00:22.030,0:00:23.310
It should be pretty similar for

0:00:23.310,0:00:26.470
this mockup because it's so similar to the one you already did.

0:00:26.470,0:00:29.530
Despite the fact that you don't know anything about Bootstrap yet,

0:00:29.530,0:00:31.720
you can get started with a new webpage.

0:00:31.720,0:00:35.120
Now that you've got the design mockup, which steps can you complete now?

0:00:35.120,0:00:37.890
Can you create a folder structure for the project?

0:00:37.890,0:00:40.280
Can you create a DOM tree for the page?

0:00:40.280,0:00:43.340
Can you write HTML that defines the DOM?

0:00:43.340,0:00:46.150
Can you assign class names to HTML elements?

0:00:46.150,0:00:47.670
Can you write CSS?

0:00:47.670,0:00:49.580
And can you the test the page?

0:00:49.580,0:00:50.330
Check all that apply.
