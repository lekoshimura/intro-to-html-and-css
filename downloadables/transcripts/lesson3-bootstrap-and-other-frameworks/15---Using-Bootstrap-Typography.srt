As you can see, we're getting pretty close to our mock up,

0:00:03.440,0:00:05.370
but the page looks a little bland.

0:00:05.370,0:00:07.710
Of course, we don't have the right colors over here, and

0:00:07.710,0:00:10.700
it also looks like the text isn't formatted quite the same either.

0:00:10.700,0:00:13.270
Notice how in the mock up we're right aligned, but

0:00:13.270,0:00:15.970
over here on our site right now we are on the left.

0:00:15.970,0:00:17.150
Also notice how this name and

0:00:17.150,0:00:21.380
title are both in all caps, while ours are capitalized normally.

0:00:21.380,0:00:24.670
Check out Bootstrap's documentation to see if there are any classes that'll help

0:00:24.670,0:00:28.700
you easily fix things like alignment and capitalization.

0:00:28.700,0:00:31.500
I recommend checking out the Typography section.

This is a two-part question.

0:00:33.298,0:00:34.340
In the first part,

0:00:34.340,0:00:40.570
pick the classes that you need to right-align text and make text all uppercase.

0:00:40.570,0:00:42.380
For the second part of this question,

0:00:42.380,0:00:45.730
which of these elements need the classes that you've defined up here?

0:00:45.730,0:00:50.310
Div class equal row, div class equals column medium six,

0:00:50.310,0:00:54.290
or is it the h1 header and h3 header?

0:00:54.290,0:00:55.000
Check all that apply
