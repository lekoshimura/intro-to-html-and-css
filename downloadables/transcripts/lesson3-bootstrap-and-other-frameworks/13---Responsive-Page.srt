0:00:00.280,0:00:02.520
So now our page has the correct layout.

0:00:02.520,0:00:06.280
But we need to make sure that our page looks good on all sized screen,

0:00:06.280,0:00:08.100
not just this big one.

0:00:08.100,0:00:09.170
So let's go ahead and resize it.

0:00:09.170,0:00:11.060
You can see it gets smaller.

0:00:11.060,0:00:13.800
And as we get closer and closer to the mobile size,

0:00:13.800,0:00:17.070
we can see that this image is being pushed off the side of the screen.

0:00:17.070,0:00:18.670
I'll go ahead and make it big again.

0:00:18.670,0:00:21.410
It's important to make sure that our websites look good on mobile too.

0:00:21.410,0:00:24.030
So, we need to make some changes using Bootstrap.

0:00:24.030,0:00:27.350
Look through the Bootstrap documentation to answer this question.

0:00:27.350,0:00:31.580
Which class should you apply to images to make them resize automatically?

0:00:31.580,0:00:32.350
