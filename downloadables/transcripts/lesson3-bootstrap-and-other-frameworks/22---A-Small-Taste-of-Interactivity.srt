So, this is what I've come up with.

0:00:01.790,0:00:05.640
I have the modal's HTML, inside the body of our page.

0:00:05.640,0:00:08.630
It has its own unique id, which in this case is project1.

0:00:08.630,0:00:13.000
It's got its own label, which is Favorite App Page.

0:00:13.000,0:00:18.020
And then inside modal-body, we have some custom content, including an image and

0:00:18.020,0:00:18.870
a big block of text.

0:00:19.970,0:00:24.630
At the very bottom, we've got a button here that will Close our modal.

0:00:24.630,0:00:25.560
Scrolling up.

0:00:25.560,0:00:30.010
We see that for the image, for the same FAVORITE APP projects,

0:00:30.010,0:00:34.000
we've got a new attribute called data-toggle and it's equal to modal.

0:00:34.000,0:00:35.980
And the target is of course project1.

0:00:35.980,0:00:39.420
Put it all together and we get to come to our page.

0:00:39.420,0:00:41.650
