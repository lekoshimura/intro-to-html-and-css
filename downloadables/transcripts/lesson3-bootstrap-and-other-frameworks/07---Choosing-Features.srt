Bootstrap is big, and

0:00:01.990,0:00:05.300
it has to be big to accommodate its impressive array of features.

0:00:05.300,0:00:08.910
That means that the files that make up the framework are actually pretty large.

0:00:08.910,0:00:11.620
This also means that for a small project like yours,

0:00:11.620,0:00:15.160
you aren't going to ever need or even use all the functionality.

0:00:15.160,0:00:17.490
But, luckily, Bootstrap allows us to pick and

0:00:17.490,0:00:19.950
choose just the parts of the framework that we need,

0:00:19.950,0:00:23.560
making the CSS file that we include with our project significantly smaller.

0:00:23.560,0:00:27.910
To customize, we'll simply go up to the Customize button at the top menu, and

0:00:27.910,0:00:29.670
then we'll choose the parts that we need.

0:00:29.670,0:00:32.600
Let's go ahead and start by unchecking everything.

0:00:32.600,0:00:37.720
For our project, we're going to need typography, grid system and modals.

0:00:37.720,0:00:40.190
After we've checked those we'll scroll down and

0:00:40.190,0:00:43.940
when we get to the bottom of the screen we see this Compile and Download button.

0:00:43.940,0:00:46.240
I want you to follow the same steps that we just went through and

0:00:46.240,0:00:47.170
click this button.

0:00:47.170,0:00:50.890
What type of file do you download when you press Compile and Download?

0:00:50.890,0:00:54.580
Is it a CSS file, an HTML file, or a ZIP file?
