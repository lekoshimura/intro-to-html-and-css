0:00:00.260,0:00:02.670
Let's take a look at the page's structure and

0:00:02.670,0:00:04.790
see if something needs to be changed.

0:00:04.790,0:00:08.900
In the instructor's notes you'll find a dom built from the design.

0:00:08.900,0:00:10.080
Check the link.

0:00:10.080,0:00:12.490
I'll go ahead and open it here by going and

0:00:12.490,0:00:15.270
opening the file because I have it saved to my local machine.

0:00:15.270,0:00:17.030
And we can see the design here.

0:00:17.030,0:00:20.050
It doesn't quite look like our orignal mock up.

0:00:20.050,0:00:22.020
Let's see if we can change it so it does.

0:00:22.020,0:00:24.210
I'll go ahead and open up the Developer Tools.

0:00:24.210,0:00:26.340
For that I'll press Command option i on my Mac.

0:00:26.340,0:00:29.070
There will be links in the instructors notes for

0:00:29.070,0:00:31.570
instructions on different operating systems.

0:00:31.570,0:00:34.340
Now that I've got my Developer Tools open.

0:00:34.340,0:00:35.480
Let's take a look.

0:00:35.480,0:00:38.240
First off, let's go a ahead and modify the header.

0:00:38.240,0:00:39.830
I will open up the div and

0:00:39.830,0:00:43.180
we can see that the header at the top of the screen is highlighted.

0:00:43.180,0:00:45.370
And let's go head and make some modifications.

0:00:45.370,0:00:47.010
Around the whole thing we need a row.

0:00:47.010,0:00:50.690
So, I'll right-click on this div and click add attribute.

0:00:50.690,0:00:54.120
I'll type in class equals row.

0:00:54.120,0:00:58.740
By adding row here you've changed the way this element on the page looks.

0:00:58.740,0:01:01.030
Inside of our row we needs some columns.

0:01:01.030,0:01:04.230
So I'll right-click on the first and click at attribute.

0:01:04.230,0:01:10.850
Here I'll type in class equals column medium 6,

0:01:10.850,0:01:15.660
indicating that we want the column here to take up half the page.

0:01:15.660,0:01:18.760
This is supposed to be the logo that's on the left side of the header.

0:01:18.760,0:01:19.970
I'll press enter and

0:01:19.970,0:01:24.300
we can see that now, this div only takes up half the screen.

0:01:24.300,0:01:25.468
Let's do the same for our name.

0:01:25.468,0:01:28.820
I will right-click on the div and click Add Attribute.

0:01:29.910,0:01:30.600
And, once again,

0:01:30.600,0:01:34.860
we wanted to take up half the screen, so we'll type class equals column.

0:01:34.860,0:01:36.950
Medium six.

0:01:36.950,0:01:38.040
Press enter. And

0:01:38.040,0:01:42.860
now we can see our two divs are each taking up half of the header.

0:01:42.860,0:01:45.120
Now, I'd like you to go through the divs for

0:01:45.120,0:01:48.550
the rest of the page and add some classes.

0:01:48.550,0:01:51.200
Do your best to make this website look like the mockup.

0:01:51.200,0:01:54.710
But be warned, you might have some structural problems.

0:01:54.710,0:01:56.210
Make sure you've got all the right divs on the page.

0:01:56.210,0:02:00.780
You might find you need to add some divs to this page in order to structure it

0:02:00.780,0:02:01.740
properly for Bootstrap.

0:02:03.040,0:02:08.190
What steps did you take to meet Bootstrap's requirements for the page structure?

0:02:08.190,0:02:11.730
Did you add a container div outside of your rows?

0:02:11.730,0:02:15.120
Did you add divs to organize your columns in to rows.

0:02:15.120,0:02:19.280
Or did you add columns inside rows to organize your content?

0:02:19.280,0:02:19.980
Check all that apply.
