You now have a pretty good idea of how to start working on a new project.

0:00:04.550,0:00:09.010
But what's the best way to learn new skills aside from just practice,

0:00:09.010,0:00:10.100
practice, practice?

0:00:10.100,0:00:12.700
I think Jacques has some ideas but

0:00:12.700,0:00:15.650
again he went back to work so we need to bug him again.

0:00:19.430,0:00:25.030
>> Heya, so I actually wanted to just mention the awesomeness that

0:00:25.030,0:00:28.820
is learning HTML and CSS on the web when you can see it every day.

0:00:28.820,0:00:32.174
So if you like something in a webpage, and you want to see how they did it

0:00:32.174,0:00:37.510
[COUGH] you can pop open DevTools and actually see how we cut it up.

0:00:37.510,0:00:39.460
So if you like something on the audacity website, and

0:00:39.460,0:00:40.850
you want to use that motif, or

0:00:40.850,0:00:44.000
that design, those type of styles, you can see what we did.

0:00:44.000,0:00:45.620
And that's really great, and

0:00:45.620,0:00:48.280
not something you can do in a lot of other environments.

0:00:48.280,0:00:52.060
So in terms of learning, it's a great place to start.

0:00:52.060,0:00:53.580
Because, I mean, that's how I started.

0:00:53.580,0:00:56.250
I was looking at how other people did,

0:00:56.250,0:00:58.560
how other people coded up their solutions.

0:00:58.560,0:01:03.270
How they managed to make something look a certain way and

0:01:03.270,0:01:04.510
being able to open it up.

0:01:04.510,0:01:06.770
And our DevTools are much better now.

0:01:06.770,0:01:12.530
And they will really allow you to dive into how somebody put something together.

0:01:12.530,0:01:15.890
So go and check out a website that you find interesting.

0:01:15.890,0:01:19.550
You'll, you'll be amazed that, sort of what people have done and

0:01:19.550,0:01:21.020
you can learn a tremendous amount from it.
