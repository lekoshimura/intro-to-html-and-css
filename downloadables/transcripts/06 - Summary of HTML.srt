You now understand how the page is structured, but

0:00:03.530,0:00:07.950
how does the browser know what the structure is and how to display it?

0:00:07.950,0:00:10.480
How does it know what images to display?

0:00:10.480,0:00:15.350
What you've seen so far is how HTML classifies page content.

0:00:15.350,0:00:20.390
It tells the browser which part is text and which is an image and so on,

0:00:20.390,0:00:25.750
but you haven't seen how the structure is turned into the actual page,

0:00:25.750,0:00:28.950
with certain paragraphs having a larger font size and

0:00:28.950,0:00:31.800
images positioned in some way on the page.

0:00:31.800,0:00:36.130
Let's investigate how this works, but first let's move to a simpler example.
