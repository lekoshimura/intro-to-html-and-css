0:00:00.640,0:00:04.810
Now imagine yourself working as a front end web developer.

0:00:04.810,0:00:08.248
You've just gotten a design from your company's graphic designer and

0:00:08.248,0:00:12.800
you now need to take this image or PDF file and turn it into a website with

0:00:12.800,0:00:18.250
all the necessary components, HTML files, CSS files, and JavaScript files.

0:00:18.250,0:00:18.820
>> Yep.

0:00:18.820,0:00:22.665
But how do you translate that visual design into an actual website, right?

0:00:22.665,0:00:24.270
And, where do you start?

0:00:24.270,0:00:25.460
What decisions do you need to make?

0:00:25.460,0:00:26.105
What do you need to know?

0:00:26.105,0:00:28.730
>> Mm-hm. >> And these are like excellent questions to ask.

0:00:28.730,0:00:32.020
But before we do that, we should probably build a good conceptual understanding

0:00:32.020,0:00:33.070
of the way websites work.

0:00:33.070,0:00:34.250
>> Yep, exactly.

0:00:34.250,0:00:38.010
So, you can think of a website much like your house.

0:00:38.010,0:00:41.740
HTML files are like the structure where the wall's placed.

0:00:41.740,0:00:43.310
What room is your livingroom?

0:00:43.310,0:00:44.220
What room is your kitchen?

0:00:44.220,0:00:45.340
Which room is your bedroom?

0:00:46.350,0:00:49.700
CSS files are then the style of your house.

0:00:49.700,0:00:50.870
What color is the carpeting?

0:00:50.870,0:00:52.630
What decorations do you have up?

0:00:52.630,0:00:53.859
What color are the walls?

0:00:57.210,0:00:59.890
JavaScript files are then your interactive components.

0:00:59.890,0:01:04.300
You can think of them like your garage door opener, or your television remote.

0:01:04.300,0:01:06.530
They're changing some element of your house.

0:01:07.830,0:01:11.100
Now much like there are rules for how things in your house behave,

0:01:11.100,0:01:14.350
you can't have a television that's just floating on the wall.

0:01:14.350,0:01:16.400
It has to be attached by something.

0:01:16.400,0:01:19.600
There are also rules for how websites behave.

0:01:19.600,0:01:21.350
The same goes for tools.

0:01:21.350,0:01:24.840
You can't put together a bookshelf, for example, without a screwdriver.

0:01:24.840,0:01:28.470
And there are also many web tools available to help you build your websites.

0:01:28.470,0:01:29.730
>> Yeah, that's a great point.

0:01:29.730,0:01:31.250
I love this analogy, it's an awesome analogy.

0:01:31.250,0:01:34.250
What do you say we get started in learning some of the basics?

0:01:34.250,0:01:34.770
>> Sounds great.
