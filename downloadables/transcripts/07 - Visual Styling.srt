Here you'll see two pages with identical HTML, even though they look different.

0:00:06.150,0:00:08.950
If you take a look at the style section on the right,

0:00:08.950,0:00:12.670
you will be able to see the styling for each element on the page.

0:00:12.670,0:00:17.080
For example, if I want to check the font size for h1,

0:00:17.080,0:00:23.420
I can click on the h1 element and find the font size is 48 pixels.

0:00:23.420,0:00:28.600
And if I want to check the border width for the image, I can look in this

0:00:28.600,0:00:34.900
div element here, find the image, and see that the border is six pixels.

0:00:34.900,0:00:39.950
Now see if you can identify the same style elements for this page.

0:00:39.950,0:00:43.910
What's the font size for h1 and what is the border width for the image?
