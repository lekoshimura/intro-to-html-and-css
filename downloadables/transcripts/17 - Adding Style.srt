0:00:00.700,0:00:05.850
Okay, so opening our file in the browser is probably not what you expected.

0:00:05.850,0:00:11.490
Looking at it in developer tools, the structure is exactly as you defined it,

0:00:11.490,0:00:13.940
but the style description isn't there and

0:00:13.940,0:00:18.996
the browser uses it's default style for all of the elements, and as you can see,

0:00:18.996,0:00:25.520
it's not very pretty and the visual layout is completely off as well.

0:00:25.520,0:00:27.320
Let's go ahead and add in some styles.

0:00:27.320,0:00:31.690
Do you remember earlier when I talked about the HTML file telling

0:00:31.690,0:00:34.640
the browser where to find the style information?

0:00:34.640,0:00:36.570
Yeah, we need to add that.

0:00:36.570,0:00:40.950
First, you need to add a single line at the start of the HTML file.

0:00:40.950,0:00:45.860
This tells the browser that the type of document is an HTML document.

0:00:45.860,0:00:50.980
Then you need to add the top level tag html because everything here

0:00:50.980,0:00:56.240
is html and don't forget, every time we have the start tag,

0:00:56.240,0:01:01.680
we also need to have the end tag and then, so our code is easier to read, we'll

0:01:01.680,0:01:07.840
indent our HTML structure so that it's located in between our two html tags.

0:01:07.840,0:01:11.610
After the html tag we need to add a head tag.

0:01:11.610,0:01:15.290
This is where you'll add the link to the style file.

0:01:15.290,0:01:21.230
To add a link to the style file, we start typing, link, and then hit Tab.

0:01:21.230,0:01:26.150
Here, Sublime Text has automatically filled in all of the information we need,

0:01:26.150,0:01:30.610
except for the name of the file that contains our style information, which,

0:01:30.610,0:01:33.414
in this case, is called style.css.

0:01:34.470,0:01:39.090
After the closure of the head tag, we then add the body tag.

0:01:39.090,0:01:43.680
Now, contained within our body tags will be our HTML structure that we

0:01:43.680,0:01:44.850
wrote before.

0:01:44.850,0:01:48.070
So we need to move this code in between our body tags.

0:01:48.070,0:01:52.650
Again, for code readability, we've indented the html structure.

0:01:52.650,0:01:55.090
So that we have a bit more to look and

0:01:55.090,0:01:58.740
work with, let's replace the placeholder description with some text.

0:01:58.740,0:02:01.410
You can choose to write your own text or

0:02:01.410,0:02:04.540
simply use what we provided in the Instructor notes.

0:02:04.540,0:02:08.759
Once the text is added, save the file and then refresh your browser page.

0:02:09.900,0:02:13.500
You can see that it updated with the text that we've included and

0:02:13.500,0:02:17.050
since you've linked your style sheet to your HTML file,

0:02:17.050,0:02:22.990
you can go to the style.css file and add some style to the page,

0:02:22.990,0:02:26.760
and just for fun, how about we add the following style.

0:02:26.760,0:02:29.310
Save the file and refresh your browser.

0:02:29.310,0:02:31.830
Then tell me what happened.

0:02:31.830,0:02:35.920
Did the box with class description turn red?

0:02:35.920,0:02:38.910
Did all text turn red, or

0:02:38.910,0:02:44.470
did the text in the description box turn red, or did nothing happen?
