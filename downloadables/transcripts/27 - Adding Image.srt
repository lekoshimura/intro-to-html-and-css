The page is starting to look more like the design,

0:00:02.710,0:00:05.030
but we're still missing the image.

0:00:05.030,0:00:09.730
To use the image, you have to store it somewhere where the page can access it.

0:00:09.730,0:00:15.250
Make a folder called images inside your Project folder and put the image there.

0:00:15.250,0:00:20.396
Make sure the image name does not contain any spaces or accented characters or

0:00:20.396,0:00:23.733
else, it will make linking to it more difficult.

0:00:23.733,0:00:27.178
You can add the image to the page with the tag img and

0:00:27.178,0:00:30.310
providing the source of the image, like so.

0:00:30.310,0:00:35.990
You should also always provide this alt attribute, which displays alternate

0:00:35.990,0:00:40.720
information to the screen in case the browser cannot display the image.

0:00:41.760,0:00:43.160
Once you have added the image,

0:00:43.160,0:00:46.449
the page look a lot more like the actual design mock.

0:00:47.670,0:00:50.650
But how does our page still differ from the design mock?

0:00:51.820,0:00:55.640
Is the header background and text color still different?

0:00:56.720,0:01:00.420
Are the margins and padding for the boxes still different?

0:01:01.440,0:01:04.250
What about the borders of the boxes?

0:01:04.250,0:01:07.290
What about the font size and style?

0:01:07.290,0:01:08.900
Do we still need to update those?
