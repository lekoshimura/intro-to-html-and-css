So, this was a design mock given to me by a designer.

0:00:04.460,0:00:08.990
The left pane here is just information on colors.

0:00:08.990,0:00:10.730
So, you can just ignore it for now.

0:00:10.730,0:00:14.120
Now, we just finished talking about boxes and boxes and

0:00:14.120,0:00:16.810
how fun it is to draw boxes around things.

0:00:16.810,0:00:21.690
So, when you see a page like this, we need to start looking at it and think,

0:00:21.690,0:00:26.880
how do I draw a box around every visual element here, and then, how do I

0:00:26.880,0:00:32.759
do it until I'm down to a very simple element, like a single image or paragraph?

0:00:32.759,0:00:36.420
Well, the best way to learn how is to actually do it.

0:00:36.420,0:00:38.700
I'll get you started by drawing the first three.

0:00:38.700,0:00:41.360
First, we'll have a box around this header here.

0:00:42.460,0:00:47.000
Now, inside this box, I see two other boxes.

0:00:47.000,0:00:53.270
One around our image here, and another around our name and title over here.

0:00:53.270,0:00:57.950
Now it's your turn to draw the rest of the boxes around the remaining elements.

0:00:57.950,0:01:01.370
A link to the mock is included for you in instructor notes.

0:01:01.370,0:01:03.830
Now don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.

0:01:03.830,0:01:07.420
When you're done please let me know how you completed this task,

0:01:07.420,0:01:10.260
and how many boxes you ended up using to divide the page.

0:01:11.520,0:01:17.060
Now, when you boxify this design, and yes, that's a technical term, boxify,

0:01:17.060,0:01:22.220
did you save an image of the design and draw boxes with a graphics program?

0:01:22.220,0:01:27.090
Did you just draw the boxes separately on a piece of paper?

0:01:27.090,0:01:30.730
Did you print out the page and draw on it?

0:01:30.730,0:01:35.030
Or did you print out the page and cut it up with scissors?

0:01:35.030,0:01:38.100
And don't forget to let me know how many boxes you found on the page.
