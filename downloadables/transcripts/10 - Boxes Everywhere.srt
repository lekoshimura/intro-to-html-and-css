Earlier you learned that every element on the Wikipedia web page seemed to

0:00:04.620,0:00:08.940
be a box, even the completely not-rectangular images.

0:00:08.940,0:00:10.000
But wait.

0:00:10.000,0:00:12.380
How can everything be a box?

0:00:12.380,0:00:17.380
I mean, there are other shapes in the world like circles, right?

0:00:17.380,0:00:19.010
Well, that is very true.

0:00:19.010,0:00:23.220
On a website, something may look like a circle or

0:00:23.220,0:00:28.150
a triangle or something a little more irregular, but, in fact,

0:00:28.150,0:00:33.130
it's still just a box, it just looks like a circle.

0:00:33.130,0:00:34.200
Don't believe it?

0:00:34.200,0:00:35.880
Neither did I the first time.

0:00:35.880,0:00:38.140
Let's take a look at this demo site.

0:00:38.140,0:00:43.590
On this site we have three very nice circles, and we've even got a triangle.

0:00:43.590,0:00:47.050
I mean, these can't just be rectangles, right.

0:00:47.050,0:00:49.160
Or can they?

0:00:49.160,0:00:51.540
Right clicking on the first circle and

0:00:51.540,0:00:55.820
selecting inspect element brings up Google developer tools

0:00:55.820,0:01:00.530
in the exact location where the circle is located in the structure.

0:01:01.740,0:01:02.310
Wait.

0:01:02.310,0:01:04.556
What?

0:01:04.556,0:01:07.470
My mind was just blown.

0:01:08.590,0:01:11.820
So, what exactly is going on here?

0:01:11.820,0:01:15.530
In this left panel we have the structure that we are already so

0:01:15.530,0:01:20.170
familiar with and this part seems to define our circle.

0:01:20.170,0:01:25.870
If I highlight this line in Developer tools it highlights a rectangular

0:01:25.870,0:01:31.700
shape on the page but where does the visible round shape come from?

0:01:31.700,0:01:34.660
I talked a little something about style earlier.

0:01:34.660,0:01:39.490
So the answer is probably in the style panel here on the right.

0:01:39.490,0:01:43.950
What you see here are the styles used to display the element selected in

0:01:43.950,0:01:45.010
the left panel.

0:01:45.010,0:01:47.980
The very cool thing is that you can change the style and

0:01:47.980,0:01:49.800
immediately see the result.

0:01:49.800,0:01:55.240
So, for example, maybe I don't want an even number of pixels for within height.

0:01:55.240,0:01:58.589
Maybe I want to change this 200 to 100.

0:01:58.589,0:02:00.070
What happens?

0:02:00.070,0:02:03.690
Looks like we have more of an oval then a circle.

0:02:03.690,0:02:06.820
And, maybe, I don't like the color green.

0:02:06.820,0:02:10.009
But I don't know what color I want my circle to be.

0:02:10.009,0:02:14.900
If I click on this little color square, it brings up a selection tool,

0:02:14.900,0:02:18.860
where I can select any color in the visible spectrum.

0:02:18.860,0:02:20.020
Let's go with blue.

0:02:20.020,0:02:22.280
Now, go ahead, open this page.

0:02:22.280,0:02:25.750
The link is provided to you in the instructor notes section.

0:02:25.750,0:02:28.680
And play around with the style of the circles on your own.

0:02:28.680,0:02:33.070
Particularly, take a look at what happens if you uncheck the border radius

0:02:33.070,0:02:38.230
property and if at anytime you decide that your change has got a little

0:02:38.230,0:02:42.550
too crazy and you want to go back to normal, you can just refresh the page.

0:02:43.620,0:02:47.640
So, what did happen when you unchecked border radius?

0:02:47.640,0:02:49.940
Did the circle disappear?

0:02:49.940,0:02:52.820
Did the circle turn into a square?

0:02:52.820,0:02:55.820
Did the circle become smaller?

0:02:55.820,0:02:57.280
Or, did nothing happen?
