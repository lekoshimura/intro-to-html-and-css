Changing the visual properties of an element only changes how the element is

0:00:05.220,0:00:09.020
displayed, not what kind of element it is.

0:00:09.020,0:00:11.861
You should be sure to choose the right type of element for

0:00:11.861,0:00:15.865
certain parts of a page, depending on the what the purpose of that element is.

0:00:15.865,0:00:21.220
For example, in this page, the title at the top of

0:00:21.220,0:00:27.520
the page is really text giving the user an understanding of what is on the page.

0:00:27.520,0:00:31.820
So you should be using a tag that provides such information.

0:00:31.820,0:00:38.040
Think of it in terms of a Microsoft Word, Google Doc, or Open Office document.

0:00:38.040,0:00:42.500
When you're typing in a document you might select different headings in order to

0:00:42.500,0:00:46.780
tell the user what part of the document they're reading.

0:00:46.780,0:00:49.620
In HTML you can do the exact same thing.

0:00:51.090,0:00:57.500
Except we call these tags H1 and H2, H3, etc.

0:00:57.500,0:01:01.250
Search engines also use headings to index the structure and

0:01:01.250,0:01:02.680
content of a web page.

0:01:02.680,0:01:07.947
Therefore, you can change the div tag to the more appropriate H1 tag for

0:01:07.947,0:01:08.819
our title.

0:01:09.910,0:01:13.790
Go ahead and do so and then refresh your browser and tell me what happened.

0:01:15.240,0:01:17.780
What did happen to the text, My App?

0:01:18.900,0:01:20.950
Did nothing visibly change?

0:01:22.960,0:01:25.600
Or did the the text change in size?

0:01:27.160,0:01:30.430
Or did the box around the text change?

0:01:30.430,0:01:33.220
Be sure to select any and all that apply.
