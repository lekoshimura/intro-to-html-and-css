Great, so you know how to chop up a webpage design into boxes and

0:00:04.720,0:00:08.410
you've even heard advice from an experienced front end developer.

0:00:08.410,0:00:11.370
Let's take a look at another very simple example.

0:00:11.370,0:00:15.620
How do you transfer this to an HTML document,

0:00:15.620,0:00:18.170
and how do you change how the boxes look?

0:00:18.170,0:00:21.410
Let me quickly show you how to translate the model to HTML.

0:00:21.410,0:00:25.080
And then you will write it in a file that you can open in your browser.

0:00:25.080,0:00:28.610
In this design, you can see that there are four boxes.

0:00:28.610,0:00:32.000
We have one over the title, another over this content, and

0:00:32.000,0:00:36.320
then two more boxes inside of this larger box.

0:00:36.320,0:00:39.810
One around the image, and another around the text.

0:00:39.810,0:00:44.790
So let's not worry about how these boxes look or what's inside of them.

0:00:44.790,0:00:48.190
And let's not worry that I haven't actually perfectly aligned the top of

0:00:48.190,0:00:49.330
this box with that one.

0:00:49.330,0:00:52.200
It's driving me crazy but we don't have to worry about it right now.

0:00:52.200,0:00:55.870
Now you can define this type of box with a div tag.

0:00:55.870,0:00:59.040
We'll write this code using Sublime Text and

0:00:59.040,0:01:04.190
we suggest that you use either this code editor or something similar.

0:01:04.190,0:01:07.360
Now we define boxes with div tags.

0:01:07.360,0:01:11.470
So let's go ahead and create tags for each of our boxes.

0:01:11.470,0:01:15.770
First, we'll start with the title box and start typing div.

0:01:15.770,0:01:20.350
Now this is the really nice thing of using a code editor like Sublime Text.

0:01:20.350,0:01:23.880
It automatically is guessing what we might use.

0:01:23.880,0:01:28.820
So, we do know we want it to be a div, we can click tab, and

0:01:28.820,0:01:34.150
now we have the completed HTML tags, an opening tag, and a closing tag.

0:01:34.150,0:01:39.480
Next we have another box for the content which requires another div tag.

0:01:39.480,0:01:43.120
And now within this box, we have two more boxes.

0:01:43.120,0:01:50.830
So we'll hit another line, so now we have four div tags for our four boxes.

0:01:50.830,0:01:53.220
Now let's add some placeholder content so

0:01:53.220,0:01:57.460
that we remember which boxes each of our tags refer to.

0:01:57.460,0:02:01.000
So our first one is for our title, which is, My App.

0:02:01.000,0:02:04.160
And then we have our image and our text.

0:02:05.490,0:02:06.340
Now that's great.

0:02:06.340,0:02:08.830
But how do you apply a style to them?

0:02:08.830,0:02:12.620
The boxes are of different sizes and they're in different locations.

0:02:12.620,0:02:15.750
And you need to somehow mark them so that you can easily apply style later.

0:02:15.750,0:02:20.690
Now the best way to do this is to give each element a class attribute.

0:02:20.690,0:02:24.370
Now, you can think of these class attributes as labels on boxes,

0:02:24.370,0:02:27.830
something that reminds you of what's inside of them.

0:02:27.830,0:02:31.860
For example, when you move you might give a box a label to let

0:02:31.860,0:02:33.930
the movers know where it might go.

0:02:33.930,0:02:36.790
For example, master bedroom or kitchen.

0:02:38.620,0:02:41.110
Now boxes can also have several labels and

0:02:41.110,0:02:45.550
the same applies to HTML tags, they can belong to multiple classes.

0:02:45.550,0:02:47.020
Now back to our moving example,

0:02:47.020,0:02:50.530
you might want to say the items that go to the kitchen are also fragile.

0:02:50.530,0:02:52.250
So, you might add Handle with Care.

0:02:53.300,0:02:56.390
It's a good idea to have class names that make sense so

0:02:56.390,0:03:00.900
that you understand what the purpose of the box is just by glancing at the code.

0:03:00.900,0:03:06.674
For example, while you could just give the divs class names like box 1,

0:03:06.674,0:03:08.300
box 2, et cetera.

0:03:08.300,0:03:09.970
It's not really informative.

0:03:09.970,0:03:14.650
I mean, will you really remember that you called this title box box1?

0:03:14.650,0:03:15.360
Probably not.

0:03:15.360,0:03:19.650
What would make more sense is to name the top div title, and

0:03:19.650,0:03:22.210
then the bottom big div app.

0:03:23.260,0:03:28.640
Then the div that contains the application image, screenshot.

0:03:28.640,0:03:31.680
And the text one, description.

0:03:31.680,0:03:32.610
Excellent.

0:03:32.610,0:03:35.740
We now have the general structure of the page down.

0:03:35.740,0:03:39.380
So, now it's your turn to save this in a file and

0:03:39.380,0:03:41.090
see how it looks in the browser.

0:03:41.090,0:03:42.870
Instructions for doing so follow.
