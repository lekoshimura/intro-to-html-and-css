When you change the DIV tag to an H1 tag, the text should have changed in size,

0:00:05.960,0:00:09.000
and also the box around the text should have changed.

0:00:10.510,0:00:15.050
Looking at this in the browser, when we change this DIV tag to H1,

0:00:16.170,0:00:22.410
save the file, and refresh our browser, we see that the text got bigger,

0:00:22.410,0:00:26.750
and we also have extra space above and below the text.

0:00:26.750,0:00:31.690
We can verify this in Developer tools by mousing over H1,

0:00:31.690,0:00:37.280
and you'll see that we have a rectangle around the My App title.
