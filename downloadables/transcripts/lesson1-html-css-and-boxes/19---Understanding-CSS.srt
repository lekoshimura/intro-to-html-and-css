0:00:00.000,0:00:02.091
Great.

0:00:02.091,0:00:04.447
Now that you have the structure of the page down,

0:00:04.447,0:00:07.563
you can work on making it look like the design you were provided.

0:00:07.563,0:00:12.960
Now to do this, you need to use CSS or Cascading Style Sheets.

0:00:12.960,0:00:16.460
Now you can probably assume that style means looks or

0:00:16.460,0:00:19.750
the way that the web site will appear to the user.

0:00:19.750,0:00:22.790
But what do cascading and sheets mean?

0:00:23.950,0:00:27.120
First, you can have several CSS files or

0:00:27.120,0:00:30.610
sheets that will be referenced in HTML and

0:00:30.610,0:00:35.650
all of them will be used to find out the final and visible style for your page.

0:00:35.650,0:00:38.210
Think of it in terms of laws.

0:00:38.210,0:00:43.770
You have a national law that deals with how your country is organized and then

0:00:43.770,0:00:48.910
you might have state laws, which tell you can or cannot do in a given state.

0:00:48.910,0:00:53.612
And then you might have municipality laws, which specify what you can or

0:00:53.612,0:00:55.165
cannot do in your city.

0:00:55.165,0:00:58.939
And then at the end, you might have your own house rules.

0:00:58.939,0:01:01.210
Well, CSS is a bit different.

0:01:01.210,0:01:05.369
Because with CSS the most specific rule is applied to every element.

0:01:06.430,0:01:12.070
So your house rules would actually be the same as the national laws.

0:01:12.070,0:01:15.450
Wouldn't this be awesome if this was true in real life?

0:01:15.450,0:01:17.500
For example, I went to school in Orlando.

0:01:17.500,0:01:20.569
And I made it a rule that we did theme park Mondays.

0:01:20.569,0:01:23.244
Meaning, if I had time on Monday, I went to the theme park.

0:01:23.244,0:01:24.880
It was a house rule.

0:01:24.880,0:01:27.470
Wouldn't that be great if it was national law?

0:01:27.470,0:01:29.870
I can go to a theme park every Monday.

0:01:30.890,0:01:34.800
Now, this concept of most specific rule applied is what

0:01:34.800,0:01:37.160
the word cascading means.

0:01:37.160,0:01:38.790
You keep going down and

0:01:38.790,0:01:43.490
down into the rules until you find the one that best describes the elements.

0:01:43.490,0:01:45.240
And then that rule gets applied
