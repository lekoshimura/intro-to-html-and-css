I really liked that last demo where we turned circles into squares.

0:00:04.470,0:00:07.520
It really shows the awesome power of style and

0:00:07.520,0:00:11.150
also represents that everything on a webpage is actually a box.

0:00:12.340,0:00:16.560
But why is it so important to really understand that concept?

0:00:16.560,0:00:20.220
You might be thinking to yourself, hey, I'm not a square.

0:00:20.220,0:00:23.499
I'm actually a really cool person and I don't like to think about boxes.

0:00:24.540,0:00:27.260
But actually thinking of the things in terms of

0:00:27.260,0:00:31.610
boxes makes your life as a front-end web developer a lot easier.

0:00:32.650,0:00:34.500
Take an example website here.

0:00:34.500,0:00:38.820
We have many different elements, images, text, a header.

0:00:38.820,0:00:43.960
And by thinking of things in terms of boxes we can actually easily rearrange

0:00:43.960,0:00:47.130
things if we decide to give users a different experience.

0:00:48.240,0:00:51.250
Say, for example, we don't want to keep the text up here.

0:00:51.250,0:00:55.940
We want more pictures of puppies because users like more pictures and

0:00:55.940,0:00:57.000
might not want to read the text.

0:00:58.550,0:01:04.010
So we'll take away the text here, move some cute pictures of puppies up here,

0:01:04.010,0:01:07.100
and then put the text along the bottom.

0:01:08.500,0:01:11.580
Now readers can read the text if they'd like to or

0:01:11.580,0:01:13.480
just look at cute pictures of puppies.

0:01:15.040,0:01:17.890
There's also a grid in the background which serves to make sure that

0:01:17.890,0:01:20.210
everything is properly aligned.

0:01:20.210,0:01:22.919
But we'll talk more about that in lesson two.
